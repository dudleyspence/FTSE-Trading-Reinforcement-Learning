# FTSE-Trading-Reinforcement-Learning
An algorithmic trading bot that trains using 20 years of FTSE data and can adapt to multiple reinforcement learning algorithms. So far the hyperparameters haven't been optimized for successful results.

Unzip the training data and use the data processing function provided in the Trading bot script to preprocess the data ready for input into the algorithm.
